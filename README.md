📌 Project Title: Clinic Booking System (MySQL)
📝 Description
This project is a Clinic Booking System implemented using pure MySQL. It manages clinic operations such as patient registrations, appointment bookings, doctor scheduling, and medical records. It’s designed to demonstrate relational database design using primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and multiple relationship types (1:1, 1:N, M:N).
⚙️ How to Set Up / Run the Project
Install MySQL if you haven't already.

Open MySQL Workbench (or your preferred SQL client).

Open and execute the file:


clinic_booking_system.sql
This will create all necessary tables and relationships for the system.
